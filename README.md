# QUT-Partner-university-ranking
This was a little weekend project of mine to web-scrap qut's partner universities for exchange program and rank them according to their university rankings from Times Higher Education (THE) and Quacquarelli Symonds (QS University ranking) scores.

## Libraries used
  1. Beautiful Soup
  2. Numpy
  3. Pandas
  4. Re (RegEx module)

### Note 
The university names for this project were scraped from a local copy of  the uni website. As University websites restricits bot scripts from interacting with uni servers.

Final Reuslts of the project can be found at the bottom of the 'Top Partner Universities v1.ipynb' jyputer Notebook under 'The Results' section.
